# Visual-Steering-For-Deep-Neural-Networks

## Abstract
This repository contains the source code to visually steer the CNN models into alligning with the human knowledge fed into them.  This method is provided for integrating human knowledge with the convolutional neural network to improve its performance, reduce the biases that arise, and leverage human experience.
